# Jester
*Jester* is a plugin for the Among Us private server [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) that adds a special Jester-role to the game. At the start of each game, one player gets assigned this role. If this Jester gets voted out during a meeting they win, and all other players lose. 

This adds a special twist to the usual dynamic of Among Us - you now have to be extra careful who you vote. If someone seems suspicious they could be an imposter, but they might also just be the Jester!

## How it works

- When the hosts pushes the 'start' button in the lobby, every player has to **open the ingame chat** to see if they're the Jester.

- If this player that gets this message happens to be Imposter, there will be *no Jester* this game.
- But if this player is a crewmate, they will have the special Jester role this game!
- The Jester is just like a normal crewmate, except for the fact that the Jester can also win on their own by getting voted out.

- After a game, all players get a notification saying which player was the Jester (and if they won).
