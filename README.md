# Jester
*Jester* is a plugin for the Among Us private server [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) that adds a special Jester-role to the game. If the Jester gets voted out during a meeting the Jester wins and all other players lose. 

This adds a special twist to the usual dynamic of Among Us - you now have to be extra careful who you vote. If someone seems suspicious they could be an imposter, but they might also just be the Jester!

## How it works

- When the hosts pushes the 'start' button in the lobby, every player has to **open the ingame chat**.
- One player will get a private message in chat saying that they'll probably be the Jester.
- If this player is Imposter, there will be *no Jester* this game.
- ...but if this player is a crewmate, they will have the special **Jester** role this game.
- In addition the ways in which a normal crewmate can win, the Jester can win by getting voted out after a meeting.
- If this happens all the other players lose, so players have to be careful to not vote the Jester.
- Except for this extra way to win games, the Jester has the same capabilities as a normal crewmate.
